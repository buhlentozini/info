# The ALL-THINGS-CODE club

Technology, next-generation sequencing, and big-data have necessitated the use of coding languages to visualise, clean-up, analyse, interpret, and manage large datasets of public health importance. We are aware of the challenges that beginners face, and we do not have to figure it all out on our own!

# Objectives:

- Troubleshooting coding related issues
- Finding efficient ways of solving problems through coding
- Simplifying data analysis, manipulation and management
- Explore data visualization using coding languages
- Teach and learn from one another
